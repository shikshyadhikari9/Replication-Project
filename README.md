## Replication Project

In my statistics course, we replicated a project for two purposes: a. to put our STATA and statistical knowledge to use and b. to understand the value of a clean and transparent workflow to understand how researchers arrive at their conclusion. 

In this project, since I have been learning and practicing Python, I will use Python to replicate the results.
